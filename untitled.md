# Divorce Prediction using Machine Learning

## About The Project

This  'DIVORCE PREDICTOR ' project is based off of a paper published by  the title of  '[DIVORCE PREDICTION USING CORRELATION BASED FEATURE SELECTION AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/nevsosbilen/issue/46568/549416)' in June of 2019, in which the data from a survey report was used to predict the divorce in couples on the basis of Gottman couples therapy. Of the participants, 84 \(49%\) were divorced and 86 \(51%\) were married couples. In the scope of this research, it was also discovered which factors affected the divorce the most.

Here, I have take the same [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Divorce+Predictors+data+set) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository \(not complete\) and tried to analyse and see which factors affected the target variable \(Marital Status\) in my case, the most
