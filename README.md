# About The Project

This  'DIVORCE PREDICTOR ' project is based off of a paper published by  the title of  ['DIVORCE PREDICTION USING CORRELATION BASED FEATURE SELECTION AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS'](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/nevsosbilen/issue/46568/549416) in June of 2019  by Mustafa Kemal YÃ–NTEM et al. in which the data from a survey report was used to predict the divorce in couples on the basis of Gottman couples therapy. Of the participants, 84 (49%) were divorced and 86 (51%) were married couples. In the scope of this research, it was also discovered which factors affected the divorce the most.

Here, I have take the same [Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Divorce+Predictors+data+set) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (not complete) and tried to analyse and see which factors affected the target variable (Marital Status) in my case, the most.



## Built With

- Python



## Description

The Dataset was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository and contained 170 Rows and 54 columns (Reponses of Different Questions) and another column containing the target variable , which was marital status.

The responses were recorded using a google form or a similar technique, which allowed the user to answer by selecting one of the five options which ranged from 

**Strongly Agree** to **Strongly Disagree** , each of which corresponded to number ranging from 0 to 4 and marital status of every user was also recorded in the same manner **1 = Divorced**  & **0 = Married**.

For more details, please checkout the Jupyter Notebook included. 
I have explained every step of the process and if that doesn't make it clear, please feel free to connect on the links mentioned below.
